Title Slide:

Introduction to the Student Management System project.
Mention that the project utilizes Python programming language and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Highlight the key objectives of the presentation.
Slide 1: Student Class:

The Student class represents individual students in the system.
Attributes include roll number, name, age, and a list of enrolled courses.
Methods allow for adding/removing courses, updating age, and displaying student information.
Encapsulation is achieved by encapsulating student data and behaviors within the class.
Slide 2: Course Class:

The Course class represents individual courses offered in the system.
Attributes include course name and instructor.
Methods could include functions related to course management (not explicitly defined in the current example).
Encapsulation ensures that course data and behaviors are contained within the class.
Slide 3: Function to Create Students:

The create_students() function allows users to input student details interactively.
Users are prompted to enter the number of students and their respective names and ages.
The function creates instances of the Student class based on the provided input.
Error handling could be added to validate user input for roll numbers, names, and ages.
Slide 4: Function to Create Courses:

The create_courses() function enables users to input course details interactively.
Users are prompted to enter the number of courses and their names and instructors.
Instances of the Course class are created based on the provided input.
Error handling could be implemented to validate user input for course names and instructor names.
Slide 5: Enrolling Students in Courses:

Students are enrolled in courses interactively after both students and courses have been created.
The system prompts users to indicate whether each student wants to enroll in each course.
The add_course() method of the Student class is used to enroll students in courses.
The process ensures flexibility and adaptability by allowing dynamic enrollment based on user preferences.
Slide 6: Displaying Student Information:

The system displays detailed information about each student, including their name, roll number, age, and enrolled courses.
The display_info() method of the Student class is utilized to present student information.
The presentation could include a sample output demonstrating how student information is formatted and presented.
Flexibility is maintained, allowing for easy extension and customization of the display format.
